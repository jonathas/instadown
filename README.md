A Google Chrome extension developed using vanilla Javascript which shows a download button for each photo you see on Instagram, so you can save them to yourself.

In order to install it, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

Check "Developer mode" to enable loading unpacked extensions. This will allow you to load your extension from a folder.

Finally, click "Load unpacked extension" and choose the project folder.

#### TODO
- On the profile page, serve for download the full photo instead of the thumbnail
